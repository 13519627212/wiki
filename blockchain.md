## Blockchain Update

In our opinion, **Blockchain** only needs to care about how to process new blocks to grow up safely and efficiently. What's more, **Blockchain** can only get new blocks in the following two channels.

**A new block from network**

Because of the unstable network latency, we cannot make sure any new block received can be linked to our current **Chain** directly. Thus, we need the **Blocks Pool** to cache new blocks.

**A new block from local miners**

At first, we need the **Transactions Pool** to cache transactions from network. Then, we wait for a new block created by local **Consensus** component, such as PoW. 

No matter where a new block comes from, we use the same steps to process it as following.

<!-- 
@startuml addBlockInPool

start

if (the new block exists in blockchain?) then (yes)
    stop
else (no)
    if (the block's nonce is right?) then (yes)
        if (the block's hash is right?) then (yes)
            while (more transactions in the block?) is (yes)
                if (the transaction's hash is right?) then (yes)
                    if (the transaction's sign is right?) then (yes)
                    else (no)
                        stop
                    endif
                else (no)
                    stop
                endif
            endwhile (no)
            if (the block's parent exists in blockchain?) then (yes)
                :clone the block's parent's world states;
                :execute all transactions in the block;
                while (more states in the block?) is (yes)
                    if (the state root matches?) then(yes)
                    else (no)
                        stop
                    endif
                endwhile (no)
                :append the block to blockchain;
            else (no)
                :cache the block in block pool;
            endif
        else (no)
            stop
        endif
    else (no)
        stop
    endif

## World State

Every block contains the current world state, consist of following four states. They are all maintained as [Merkle Trees](./merkle_trie.md).

**Account State**

store all account states in current block

key, address; value, balance

**Transaction State(TBD)**

store all transaction data in current block

**Receipt State(TBD)**

store all events generated in the execution of all transactions in current block

**Rank State(TBD)**

store current rank result

## Serialization

At current version, we use json serializer to make things work at first.

> TODO: use Protocol Buffer instead.

> We may consider to use Protocol Buffer considering following benefits:
> - Large scale proven.
> - Efficiency. It omits key literals and use varints encoding.
> - Multi types and multilangue client support. Easy to use API.
> - Schema is good format for communication.
> - Schema is good for versioning/extension, i.e., adding new message fields or deprecating unused ones.

## Sync

### Full Sync (TBD)

Here is a entire blockchain synchronization policy to be implemented.
We starts synchronization from the snapshot of the blockchain in local storage. All blocks generated after the snapshot will be synchronized from peers and replayed locally.

``` pseudo
push all tails of current blockchain into a queue, as Q
loop if Q is not empty
  set t as Q.pop()
  if t is on canonical chain on peers' blockchains
    if t is the tail on peers' blockchains
      ask local miners to start mining
    else
      Q.push(t.children)
  else
    Q.push(t.parent)
```

### Fast Sync (TBD)

As for a light node, it needs a fast sync strategy to catch up the canonical chain.
