# Nebulas 101 - 02 Sending Transactions on Nebulas

Nebulas provides three ways to send transactions：

1. Through http port
2. Through console
3. Through Nebulas test framework

Here is an introduction to sending a transaction in Nebulas through the three methods above and verifying whether the transaction is successful.

### Preparations
Before starting neb app, some preparations are needed:

1. Create two wallet addresses: 
    * One wallet address as the mining coin wallet address on Coinbase to receive mining awards and also as the sender address of the transfer transactions. 
    * Another wallet address as the receiving address of transfer transactions.

2. Modify the node's configuration file, and configure the coinbase address.

#### Preparations Detail
1. Create a mining wallet address on Coinbase.
Coinbase corresponds to the reward address of the miner's mining. The reward that the miner gets will go to this address. So before starting the node, you need to configure the Coinbase address first. We can select one address as the address of coinbase from the six addresses in the `conf/default/genesis.conf`[`consensus-> dpos-> dynasty`]. Currently, our version is six addresses as a dynasty, rotating generate blocks, so only the first six addresses can be configured as coinbase addresses.

The generated coinbase address `1a263547d167c74cf4b8f9166cfa244de0481c514a45aa2c` needs to replace the coinbase address and the miner address in the` chain` attribute in the `conf/default/seed.conf` configuration file (shown below). Then the mining reward generated by the user after starting the neb app will enter this address.

2. Create a receiving address for transfer transactions
Now let us create transfer transactions receiving address in the same fashion.
```sh
$ ./neb account new
Your new account is locked with a passphrase. Please give a passphrase. Do not forget this passphrase.
Passphrase:
Repeat passphrase:
Address: e6dea0d0769fbf71ab01f8e0d78cd59e78361a450e1f4f88
```
After executing this command, the neb program will generate a new Key file corresponding to the address in the `keydir` sub-directory in the current directory as shown in the figure:
![key](resources/101-02-new-key.png)

### Start the Neb App
After completing all the preparations, you can start the neb app:
```
$ ./neb -c conf/default/seed.conf
```
The neb app loads the `conf/default/seed.conf` configuration file we set earlier. After starting, neb app will enter mining mode by defult. After a period of time (1 to 2 minutes), mining reward will be sent to the coinbase account address we set before. The current development code mining reward is 16 NAS (which will be adjusted according to the requirements of the white paper). The average block time is about 10 seconds.

### Check Balance
Nebulas provides the RPC port, allowing developers to interact with the Nebulas via HTTP or gPRC protocols for more complex operations. Here, we introduce how to check the balance of each account through the port of HTTP protocol. The Nebulas HTTP port's address and port is configured via the `api_http_port` attribute in the configuration file. The default port is 8090.

Next, we use curl to show the RPC calls.

We can check this Coinbase address account balance's port to see this user's mining reward. When the Coinbase account address has a balance, transfer transactions can be made.
After the system starts, we can query the balance information of the account by sending an http request by curl. The following return value indicates that the balance of this address is 64:

```
// Request
curl -i -H Accept:application/json -X POST http://localhost:8090/v1/user/accountstate -d '{"address":"1a263547d167c74cf4b8f9166cfa244de0481c514a45aa2c"}'

// Result
{
   "Balance":"64"，
   "nonce":"0"
}
```


### Send and Verify Transfer Transactions

To send a transfer transaction, follow these steps:

1. Get the account information;

```
// Request
curl -i -H Accept:application/json -X GET http://localhost:8090/v1/user/accounts

// Result
{
   "addresses":[
       "1a263547d167c74cf4b8f9166cfa244de0481c514a45aa2c",
       "e6dea0d0769fbf71ab01f8e0d78cd59e78361a450e1f4f88"
   ]
}
```
This port returns all the account information in the currently started node, from which we can find the Coinbase account address (red) we created earlier and the transfer receiving account address (blue).

2. Find the account whose account balance is greater than 0, and unlock the account;

```
// Request
curl -i -H Accept:application/json -X POST http://localhost:8191/v1/admin/account/unlock -d '{"address":"1a263547d167c74cf4b8f9166cfa244de0481c514a45aa2c", "passphrase":"passphrase"}'

// Result
{
   "result":true
}
```
This port unlock the sender's address which is needed for the transfer transactions mentioned in the Preparations. To unlock the account, you need to use the password from when creating the address.

3. Make a fund transfer transaction to another account using an unlocked account;

```
// Request
curl -i -H 'Accept: application/json' -X POST http://localhost:8191/v1/user/transaction -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"from":"1a263547d167c74cf4b8f9166cfa244de0481c514a45aa2c","to":"e6dea0d0769fbf71ab01f8e0d78cd59e78361a450e1f4f88","nonce": 1,"value": 10}'

// Result
{
  "txhash": "93930906f21282b4cd72de8292d122806f65e6803cddd9e9e203561996237ace"
}
```
Transfer transaction port: account `0fba` to account `6c05`, transfer amount 10. The nonce here must be the user's last nonce + 1, and the last nonce value of the user can be obtained by querying the account balance information. The port return value is the hash value of the transaction. This hash value can be used to query the transaction.

4. Wait for about 30s, and then check the transfer transaction information (because the transfer transaction requires the miner to confirm, so there will be a delay);

```
// Request
curl -i -H Accept:application/json -X POST http://localhost:8090/v1/user/getTransactionReceipt -d '{"hash":"93930906f21282b4cd72de8292d122806f65e6803cddd9e9e203561996237ace"}'

// Result
{
   "hash":"93930906f21282b4cd72de8292d122806f65e6803cddd9e9e203561996237ace",
   "from":"1a263547d167c74cf4b8f9166cfa244de0481c514a45aa2c",
   "to":"e6dea0d0769fbf71ab01f8e0d78cd59e78361a450e1f4f88",
   "nonce":"1",
   "timestamp":"1511519091",
   "chainId":1
}
```
This port can query the previous transfer transactions. The request parameter is the hash value of the previous transfer transaction. If you can check the transaction information, that means the transaction was successfully executed.

5. Check the balance of transfer receiving account to verify whether the transfer transaction is successful;

```
// Request
curl -i -H Accept:application/json -X POST http://localhost:8090/v1/user/accountstate -d '{"address":"e6dea0d0769fbf71ab01f8e0d78cd59e78361a450e1f4f88"}'

// Result
{
   "balance":"10"
}
```

### Console
Nebulas provides JavaScript console. The console implements [API](https://github.com/nebulasio/wiki/blob/master/rpc.md) and [Admin](https://github.com/nebulasio/wiki/blob/master/management_rpc.md) ports. The console provides functions such as view account, create account address, unlock account, transaction signature, send transactions, etc. The console needs to start the node locally, or connect to the remote node with `admin.setHost ()` after starting the console.
The steps to send a transaction through the console console are basically similar to calling http requests, and commands are much simpler.
##### Start the Console
```
./neb console
```

Starting this way will connect the local neb nodes that are started by default. The console implements the auto-completion method, using `TAB` to see the existing methods:

```js
> api.
api.accounts              api.getBlockByHash        api.sendRawTransaction
api.blockDump             api.getNebState           api.sendTransaction
api.call                  api.getTransactionReceipt
api.getAccountState       api.nodeInfo
```
```js
> admin.
admin.lockAccount                   admin.setHost
admin.newAccount                    admin.signTransaction
admin.sendTransactionWithPassphrase admin.unlockAccount
```

##### Check Account Addresses
```js
> api.accounts()
{
   "addresses": [
       "22ac3a9a2b1c31b7a9084e46eae16e761f83f02324092b09",
       "5cdadc1cfe3da0a3d067e9f1b195b90c5aebfb5afc8d43b4",
       "83a78219edbdeee19eefc48b8d9a4a7cfa02704518b54511",
       "8a209cec02cbeab7e2f74ad969d2dfe8dd24416aa65589bf"
   ]
}
```

##### Unlock Account

```js
> admin.unlockAccount("8a209cec02cbeab7e2f74ad969d2dfe8dd24416aa65589bf")
Unlock account 8a209cec02cbeab7e2f74ad969d2dfe8dd24416aa65589bf
Passphrase:
{
   "result": true
}
```

##### Send Transaction

```js
> api.sendTransaction("8a209cec02cbeab7e2f74ad969d2dfe8dd24416aa65589bf", "22ac3a9a2b1c31b7a9084e46eae16e761f83f02324092b09","5",13)
{
   "txhash": "93930906f21282b4cd72de8292d122806f65e6803cddd9e9e203561996237ace"
}
```

##### Check Transactions

```js
> api.getTransactionReceipt("93930906f21282b4cd72de8292d122806f65e6803cddd9e9e203561996237ace")
{
   "chainId": 1,
   "from": "8a209cec02cbeab7e2f74ad969d2dfe8dd24416aa65589bf",
   "hash": "93930906f21282b4cd72de8292d122806f65e6803cddd9e9e203561996237ace",
   "nonce": "13",
   "timestamp": "1511754470",
   "to": "22ac3a9a2b1c31b7a9084e46eae16e761f83f02324092b09"
}
```

### Through Nebtestkit
[nebtestkit](https://github.com/nebulasio/go-nebulas/tree/develop/nebtestkit) is an integrated testing framework based on [mocha](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha). With `nebtestkit`, you can launch one or more Nebulas nodes, assemble a complete private chain, or join an existing network, then make transfer transactions, deploy and invoke smart contracts, etc.
The use of `nebtestkit` instructions can be refered to [nebtestkit instructions](https://github.com/nebulasio/go-nebulas/blob/develop/nebtestkit/README.md), not going into detail here
