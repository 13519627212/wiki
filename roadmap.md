# Roadmap of Nebulas

## Goals

### v1.0

* Fully functional blockchain, with NR, PoD and Smart Contract (Solidity-compatible).

### v2.0

* Fully functional NF, with NVM, Protocol Code Upgrading, DIP and more smart contract languages support.

### Long term goals

* Scalability for large transaction volume.
* Subchain support.
* Zero-knowledge Proof integration.

## v1.0

* Test-net is online in 2018 Q1.
* Main-net is online in 2018 Q2.


### v0.1.0

Goals

* Implement a nebulas kernel.
* In-memory blockchain with PoW consensus.
